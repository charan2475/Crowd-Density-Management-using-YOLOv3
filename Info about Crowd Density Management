Abstract:
Innovative strategy to proximal analysis and safety via smart sensing and deep learning. Integration of cloud-based processing, automated alerts. 
Accurate prediction of human distances for heightened safety measures. Real-time alerts and signage ensure immediate compliance. Data analytics offer insights for informed decision-making. 
Showcases technology's potential for safety enhancement across diverse environments.

Proposed System:
Develop a smart sensing system to monitor real-time human proximity, detect social distancing violations using an intelligent algorithm, and generate graphical insights for intervention. 
Ensure privacy compliance, scalable deployment, and an intuitive user interface for effective public health management in various environments.

YOLO V3 architecture:
In this project we are using YOLOv3 architecture with pre-trained weights.
In YOLOv3 architecture there are following layers:
Input layer
53 convolution layers
3 Detection layers
Output layer
Input layer takes the preprocessed image frame
In 53 conv layers they used leaky ReLU activation function
The 3 detection layers which are responsible for predicting bounding boxes, objectness scores and class probabilities respectively
Finally the output layer gives the bounding boxes, probability and class as output
