# Crowd-Density-Management-using-YOLOv3
â€”This project delivers a deep learning-based 
approach to identify social distancing in interactions with 
others. The detection system is developed to analyze a video 
feed and also serves as a real-time detection tool to notify 
people to keep a safe distance from one another. This 
approach includes an alert system in voice form which alerts 
the people who are not following the protocols, provides the 
graphical insights to analyze the crowd density, and sends 
email alerts to higher officials to take control immediately. 
This application helps police officials monitor crowded areas
during COVID-19 times. So, limiting human involvement in 
maintenance and enabling real-time auto-alert systems is the 
core concept of this research. It also provides data insights for 
the trend analysis in the form of a line graph. It identifies the
areas that are overcrowded and allows police officials to take 
the necessary actions.
